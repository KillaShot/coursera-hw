				Chicken
			</div>
			<p>
				Raw chicken may contain salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and
				Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites. However, in Japan raw
				chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi,which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another
				preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw. Chicken can be cooked in
				many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded
				and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically
				common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep
				frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or buffalo wings. They are also often
				grilled for salads or tacos. Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based
				on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked
				with other methods. Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat".
				This is a misnomer, as it is the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, and is removed with the breast
				meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped
				from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly
				and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed
				separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the
				breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets". Chicken bones are hazardous to health
				as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or
				even days to make chicken stock. In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making
				chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have
				been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or "chicken
				carcasses" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.

				Meat has usually been cooked in water which is just simmering, such as in stewing; higher temperatures make meat tougher
				by causing the proteins to contract. Since thermostatic temperature control became available, cooking at temperatures
				well below boiling, 52 °C (126 °F) (sous-vide) to 90 °C (194 °F) (slow cooking), for prolonged periods has become possible;
				this is just hot enough to convert the tough collagen in connective tissue into gelatin through hydrolysis, with minimal
				toughening. With the adequate combination of temperature and cooking time, pathogens, such as bacteria will be killed,
				and pasteurization can be achieved. Because browning (Maillard reactions) can only occur at higher temperatures (above
				the boiling point of water), these moist techniques do not develop the flavors associated with browning. Meat will often
				undergo searing in a very hot pan, grilling or browning with a torch before moist cooking (though sometimes after). Thermostatically
				controlled methods, such as sous-vide, can also prevent overcooking by bringing the meat to the exact degree of doneness
				desired, and holding it at that temperature indefinitely. The combination of precise temperature control and long cooking
				duration makes it possible to be assured that pasteurization has been achieved, both on the surface and the interior
				of even very thick cuts of meat, which can not be assured with most other cooking techniques. (Although extremely long-duration
				cooking can break down the texture of the meat to an undesirable degree.) Beef can be cooked quickly at the table through
				several techniques. In hot pot cooking, such as shabu-shabu, very thinly sliced meat is cooked by the diners at the table
				by immersing it in a heated pot of water or stock with vegetables. In fondue bourguignonne, diners dip small pieces of
				beef into a pot of hot oil at the table. Both techniques typically feature accompanying flavorful sauces to complement
				the meat.

				Sushi
			</div>
			<p>
The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司,) was first made in Southeast Asia. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, 
a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was made of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months at a time for preservation. 
The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling. The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi 
became an important source of protein for the Japanese. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally 
means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, is still made by wrapping fish in 
soured fermenting rice, which causes the fish proteins to break down into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish have both a sour and an 
umami taste. Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally, when the fermented fish was taken out 
of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice was discarded. The strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a kind of narezushi made near 
Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture 
for better taste and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, allowing the fermentation process 
to be shortened and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into oshi-zushi. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden 
(usually bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo). The contemporary version, internationally known as 
"sushi", was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not 
fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands. The size of the previous sushi was about three times as large as 
contemporary ones. Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the 
fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi. The Oxford English Dictionary notes 
the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, 
sea-weed, or some other flavoring". However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 
article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.
